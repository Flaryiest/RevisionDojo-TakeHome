She never sold a single painting, never held an exhibition, and her voluminous work was only discovered after her death, stacked in silent rows throughout her small home.\n\nWhat can be inferred about Esme's motivation for painting?"

While plasticity continues into adulthood, allowing for lifelong learning and recovery from injury, the rate and extent of this reorganization generally diminish with age.

Researchers noted that lower-frequency city sounds, such as traffic rumble, can mask the lower-frequency components of bird songs, making them harder for other birds to hear. By shifting their songs to a higher pitch, the urban sparrows may be adapting to ensure their territorial calls and mating songs are more effectively communicated amidst the urban din. This suggests a remarkable vocal flexibility in these common birds.\n\nIt can be reasonably inferred that the researchers believe the higher-pitched songs of urban sparrows are:"

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has a huge effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts as an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?"

To achieve these goals, it primarily manipulates the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which commercial banks lend to each other overnight. By conducting open market operations—buying or selling government securities—the Fed can increase or decrease the total amount of money in the banking system, thereby influencing the federal funds rate. A lower rate encourages borrowing and spending, stimulating the economy but risking inflation. A higher rate discourages borrowing and spending, which can curb inflation but risks slowing economic growth. The Fed must, therefore, perform a delicate balancing act, constantly analyzing economic data to navigate the trade-offs between its two primary objectives.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?"
